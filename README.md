## Description

This is a voice based movie app that will search for movies based on the user's voice input. The voice API used is [Alan AI](https://alan.app/) (I had some free promo codes for Alan AI ðŸ˜œ). The movie data is from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/). All the buttons ranging from Themes to Add to Favorites are working and the app is fully responsive.
